# kirito
an experiment in cutting and connecting bits of array in c++

The name is kirito because slicing arrays is cutting and connecting them, like kirito. In addition, I envision this project becoming powerful, much like kirito, but never particularly likable, much like kirito.

For now it only supports vector, has runtime errors, and isn't most efficient. Mainly thinking about the syntax of using it. Do template magic later.
